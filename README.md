## What I Learned

Building Memory Lane taught me how to take a real-world problem and turn it into a fully deployed web application. Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and learned how to design an intuitive user interface focused on accessibility and usability.

I also gained experience with GitHub, debugging frontend logic, and deploying a live application using Vercel. Most importantly, I learned how to plan, build, test, and present a technical project from start to finish.
